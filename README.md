This project has been developed for one of partners during a workshop where they needed to bind 'regular' Cache objects }regitered, persistent classes)
to dynamic object in order to exchange data effective by means of REST API. The adapter allows to bridge the exsting gap in Cache JSON implementation.
With the adapter, is is easy to extend regular Cache classes by adding the adapter class into the base classes list.
